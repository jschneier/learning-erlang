### just learning some Erlang

i have never really explored the functional model of coding and I am interested
in the way Erlang does concurrency. going to do a deep dive into it over the next
few weeks at [HackerSchool](http://www.hackerschool.com).

much of the earlier code is either copied (as a way of learning by typing) or
adapted and/or slightly modified/played with from [Learn You Some
Erlang](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/).
